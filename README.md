# systemInfo


This project is my Operating System course assignment.
I developed a program in C language 
that build linux kernel in Loadable Linux Kernel and after building
the system informations such as CPU informations, process informations which selected
can be showed by commands.


./systeminfo.out                      -> only shows CPU informations.
./systeminfo.out -all                 -> CPU + system statistics
./systeminfo.out  -p                  -> CPU + process(which selected) details
./systeminfo.out  -all -p             -> CPU + system statistics + process details


I referred the sources which I used in my code.Thank you from here :)
